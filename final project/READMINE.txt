BECAUSE THE DATA txt FILE IS TOO BIG!!!
WE CAN NOT UPLOAD THE FILE TO OUR REPOSITORY.
SO HERE I WILL TALK ABOUT HOW WE GET THE DATA txt FILE. 

Operation:
1.open your git bash
2.cd in your linux master root
3.Please enter:"git log >> ~\Desktop\normal.txt"

After the operation.IF you find there is a about 650 megabytes normal.txt file on your desktop.You succeed.Then you can successfully use the py file we uploaded.

Thank you for downloading the files we failed to upload!
